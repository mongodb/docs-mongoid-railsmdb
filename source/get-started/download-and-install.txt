      Ensure you have the following dependencies installed
      in your development environment:
      
      - `Ruby version 3.0 or later <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>`__
      - `RubyGems <https://rubygems.org/pages/download>`__

   .. step:: Create a Project Directory

      In your shell, run the following command to create a 
      directory called ``railsmdb_quickstart`` for this project:

      .. code-block:: bash

         mkdir railsmdb_quickstart

      Run the following command to navigate into the project 
      directory:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd railsmdb_quickstart
   
   .. step:: Install {+cli-short+}

      In your shell, run the following command to install {+cli-short+}:

      .. code-block:: bash

         gem install railsmdb

After you complete these steps, you have a new project directory
and the driver dependencies installed.
