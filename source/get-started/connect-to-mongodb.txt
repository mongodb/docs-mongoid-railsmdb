==================
Connect to MongoDB
==================

.. procedure::
   :style: connected

   .. step:: Create your Application

      In your shell, run the following command to create a new application by
      using {+cli-short+}:

      .. code-block:: bash

         railsmdb new quickstart

      This command creates a new folder in your current directory called
      ``quickstart`` and populates it with the scaffolding for a new application
      that uses Mongoid with MongoDB.

   .. step:: Assign the Connection String

      In your shell, run the following command to navigate to the
      ``config/mongoid.yml`` file that was automatically created in the preceding step:

      .. code-block:: bash

         cd config/mongoid.yml

      Open the file in your editor of choice. Then, paste the 
      connection string that you copied from the :ref:`railsmdb-get-started-connection-string`
      step of this guide into the ``development.clients.default`` property, as
      shown in the following example:

      .. code-block:: yaml
         :emphasize-lines: 4

         development:
           clients:
             default:
               uri: <your connection string URI>

      .. note::

         To use this method to connect your application to your MongoDB Atlas
         deployment, you must remove the automatically generated
         ``development.clients.database`` and ``development.clients.hosts``
         properties.

   .. step:: Generate MVC Scaffolding

      You can use {+cli-short+} to automatically generate a model, view, and
      controller for a specified object.
      
      In your shell, run the following command to generate the model, view and
      controller for a blog post that includes a title and a body:

      .. code-block:: bash

         railsmdb generate scaffold Post title:string body:text

      The preceding command generates the necessary files for a "posts" page
      that allows you to create, update and delete blog posts.

   .. step:: Run your Application

      In your shell, run the following command to start the application server:

      .. code-block:: bash

         railsmbd server

      After the server is running, you can access the application by navigating
      to `localhost:3000 <https://localhost:3000>`__ in your browser. You can access the "posts" page by
      navigating to `localhost:3000/posts <https://localhost:3000>`__.
