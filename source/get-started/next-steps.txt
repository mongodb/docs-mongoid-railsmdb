Congratulations on completing the tutorial!

In this tutorial, you created an application with {+cli-short+} that
connects to a MongoDB deployment hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

You can use Mongoid, the officially supported object-document mapper for MongoDB
in Ruby, to work with applications built with {+cli-short+}. To learn more about
working with Mongoid, see the official `Mongoid documentation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/>`__.

.. TODO: Add learn more links when pages are done.
.. Learn more about {+cli-short+} from the following resources:

.. - Learn how to perform read operations in the :ref:`<pymongo-read>` section.
.. - Learn how to perform write operations in the :ref:`<pymongo-write>` section.
